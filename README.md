Task 7: Creating Views.

I used pgAdmin 4 to create and use views based on SELECT queries from existing tables.

In this task, I created SQL views to simplify complex queries and improve abstraction. I used the CREATE VIEW command to define views and used them to display filtered or computed data from one or more tables.

This helped me understand how views work, how they improve data security and reusability, and how they can be used to simplify reporting or data access.

The project includes:

A .sql file with view creation and usage examples

Screenshots showing the view outputs in pgAdmin 4
